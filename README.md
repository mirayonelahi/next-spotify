# Notes While developing

- We will be using the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) library for styling.

- add chakraprovider to the App.tsx file

- create a theme and pass it to the chakraprovider

- Box in Chakra is like a div

- fisrt we crate a basic component which will be shown all over in app.

- for scorrling any div we need to give it a fix height or fix width and make the overflow auto
